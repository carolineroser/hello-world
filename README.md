# hello-world
My first project for getting started

Caroline here, I am a Freshman at K-State Polytechnic, for Computer Systems Technology.... and I love it here in Salina!
I have two pet snakes named Coco and Bubba. They are Columbian Rainbow Boas.
I have traveled to Mexico, Ethiopia, Germany and Haiti, and plan to continue to travel around the world to experience different cultures!
